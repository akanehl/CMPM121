KNOWN BUGS/ERRORS
----------------------------------
When changing shapes, modifications do not carry over.

When saving/loading, If shapes switch, saving/loading will not work. 

Upon start, all 3 shapes are visible, but once a shape is changed the others are set to inactive.

(Please try and give half credit/points where you can, most of it is partially working, just not with the shapes...)
